The four folders here contain code for analytic and numerical solutions to the seismic equations in continuous media.
The code here was used to produce the four figures in the paper "" which may be found at ... 
The Fortran code was used for all forward integration of seismic pulses, and the data stored in text files. 
This data was then read by the Matlab code to produce the figures. 
The Fortran code was compiled using the PGI Fortran compiler, but adaptation to GFortran or other is not difficult. 
Adaptation of the Matlab code to Python and matplotlib also should be straightforward, if desired.
